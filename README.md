Title: Scenario Projections for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and RSV Burden in the US (2023-2024)
This project aims at projecting the hospitalizations of COVID-19, influenza and RSV for 23-24 season based on plausible scenarios. 
The codes are developed susing Python and jupyter script is used to run these codes. The required packages to be installed are included in the code. 
The contents are:
1. The three folders on data include the necessary and supporting data used in this scenario analysis to produce the results.
2. The code folders contain the final main code that generates the results.
   ** To replicate the code and run, the calling of data needs to chnaged accordingly depending on the folder it is stored in.
